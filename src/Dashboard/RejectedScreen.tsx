    <p>Thank you so much for your interest in attending TreeHacks. Unfortunately, we do not have enough space to offer you a spot this year. We received thousands of amazing applications, and we wish that we had the capacity to have everyone come.</p>
    <p>We'd like to encourage you to keep in touch, and we'd love to see you apply again next year. Also, check out our website the weekend of TreeHacks - we'll have hackpacks and cool resources for you to access. In the meantime, we'd love to see you continue to build and to create amazing things!</p>
    <p>Hacker love,</p>
    <p>The TreeHacks Team</p>
